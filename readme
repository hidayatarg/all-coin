First add the peer via add peer method

add then make peer value in data to listen to that p2p port: `ws://localhost:6001`
suppose bellow code

From Terminal: `HTTP_PORT=3003 P2P_PORT=6003 npm run start`


second way is to give peer manaully - done after bug fixing which will be implemented later
HTTP_PORT=3004 P2P_PORT=6004 PEERS=ws://localhost:6001 npm run start
